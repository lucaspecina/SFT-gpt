        "Explain the concept of supervised learning in simple terms.": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on labeled data, which means it's given some examples of what it's supposed to do and how it should behave. The goal is to teach the algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on those labeled examples.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nLet's say you have a smartphone with a camera that can recognize objects. You take a picture of a cat and tell the camera, \"This is a cat.\" The camera has been trained",
