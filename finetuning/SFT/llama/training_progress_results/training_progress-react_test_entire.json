        "Explain the concept of supervised learning in simple terms.": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on a set of examples, with labeled data, to learn patterns and relationships between variables. Here's a simple explanation:\n\nImagine you're trying to learn how to recognize images of different animals. You show an algorithm a set of pictures of cats and dogs, and you tell it what animals are in each picture (e.g. \"this is a cat\" or \"this is a dog\").\n\nThe algorithm looks at the pictures and tries",

        "Summarize the main idea of the theory of relativity.": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental concept in modern physics that revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. The core idea is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. Here's a simplified summary of the main ideas:\n\n**Special Relativity (1905)**\n\n1. **The speed of light is constant**: The speed of light (approximately 186,282 miles per second) is always constant"
