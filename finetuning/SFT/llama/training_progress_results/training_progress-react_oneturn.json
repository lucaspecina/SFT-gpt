        "Explain the concept of supervised learning in simple terms.": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where you have a labeled dataset, which means you already know the correct answer or output for a given input. The goal is to teach a machine to make predictions or decisions based on that data.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nImagine you're a teacher and you want to teach a child to recognize pictures of animals. You show the child a picture of a cat and say, \"This is a cat.\" You also show the child a picture of a dog",

        "Summarize the main idea of the theory of relativity.": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental concept in modern physics that challenges our classical understanding of space and time. The two main components of the theory are:\n\n1. **Special Relativity (1905)**: This theory posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. The theory states that the speed of light is constant and the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This led to the famous equation"
